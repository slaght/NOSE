								data-content="Software tools have improved significantly since the 1970s’ projects used to calibrate the 1981 version of COCOMO. The tool rating ranges from simple edit and code, very low, to integrated life-cycle management tools, very high. A Nominal Use of Software Tools rating in COCOMO 81 is equivalent to a Very Low Use of Software Tools rating in COCOMO II. An emerging extension of COCOMO II is in the process of elaborating the Use of Software Tools rating scale and breaking out the effects of Use of Software Tools capability, maturity, and integration."

								data-content="Given the increasing frequency of multisite developments, and indications that multisite development effects are significant, the Multisite Development cost driver has been added in COCOMO II. Determining its cost driver rating involves the assessment and judgement-based averaging of two factors: site collocation (from fully collocated to international distribution) and communication support (from surface mail and some phone access to full interactive multimedia). For example, if a team is fully collocated, it doesn’t need interactive multimedia to achieve an Extra High rating. Narrowband e-mail would usually be sufficient."

								data-content="<p>This rating measures the schedule constraint imposed on the project team developing the software. The ratings are defined in terms of the percentage of schedule stretch-out or acceleration with respect to a nominal schedule for a project requiring a given amount of effort. Accelerated schedules tend to produce more effort in the earlier phases to eliminate risks and refine the architecture, more effort in the later phases to accomplish more testing and documentation in parallel. Schedule compression of 75% is rated very low. A schedule stretch-out of 160% is rated very high. Stretch-outs do not add or decrease effort. Their savings because of smaller team size are generally balanced by the need to carry project administrative functions over a longer period of time.</p> <p>Required Development Schedule is the only cost driver that is used to describe the effect of schedule compression / expansion for the whole project. The scale factors are also used to describe the whole project. All of the other cost drivers are used to describe each module in a multiple module project.</p>"
